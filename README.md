# SimpleGitHubSample
This is a first attempt at using both Git and GitHub.
For this experiment I will be using the Tutorial by Derek Banas for Android development.
This starts out as a Hello World basic app and then morphs in order to add Android features.
Lowest Android version will be API 8 (Froyo 2.2).
